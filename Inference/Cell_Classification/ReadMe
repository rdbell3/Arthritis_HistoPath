This is how you perfomrm Cell Classification with the modles in Bell and Bredel et al
1) Perfrom Nuclei segmentation and feature exration as specified in the "Training" section
2) use provided models to infer cell type class with Infer_on_Cells.py
3) Convert predition to mask that can be imported into QuPath with ROI_First_c2m_QuPAth_v3.py
4) Import masks to QuPath with Import_Cell_Masks_as_Annotations_QuPath_from_inference_Batch_2.groovy
